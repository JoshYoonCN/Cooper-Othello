classes:
space
board
- made of space classes
- print board
piece
- black, white (b,w)


game logic:
- check if any pieces of different color are around placed piece
- if yes, then continue checking in that line until valid condition met or hit space
- make 10*10 board and so only have to check for empty space for invalid
